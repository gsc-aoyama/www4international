◎Class topic: Japanese Calligraphy
◎Name of instructor: Mr. Haru http://www.kakigokoro.com/

”Mr. Haru, a professional Japanese Calligrapher, showed his performance of writing “Hope” on a very large paper. It was truly amazing and cool! Everyone practiced Japanese calligraphy with Bokuju, Indian ink, and writing brushes. It was difficult to write characters using such tools, but by the end of the class, we all managed!” (Experience shared by   Mika Hashida)
